## Overview

The challenge was to make a rating card, allowing customers to rate their experience with a given website.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

This is my first project using JavaScript. Conceptually in terms of what I had to do, it wasn't too hard because I have previous experience with Java. 

I first built the project with HTML and CSS (mobile-first), then did the desktop version, and then applied JavaScript to it.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned how to use JavaScript to access HTML elements and their CSS properties as well as change or replace them.

### Continued development

I plan to continue to do Frontend Mentor but more specifically, target JavaScript projects.
